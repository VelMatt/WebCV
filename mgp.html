		<p> I found the research stage of this project to be incredibly inspiring and exciting for how well developed the websites i was looking into;
		some of them contained really great and interesting ways of doing things i have done incredibly basically. One of my personal favourites was <a href="http://salleedesign.com/home/" target="_blank">Salee Design website</a>
		You can see an image of the front page below. </p>

	<div class="pagecontent">
		<p> I really liked how this page so naturally transitioned from the opening image into the text below. However i did find a lot of influence in the simple
		minimalist design of the way the text is layed out on the salee website as well as several of the other linked websites, a minamilist design has several advantadges
		when designing a website.</p>	
	
		<div class="listcenter">
			<ul>
				<li>Reduces page load</li>
				<li>Is easy to transition to mobile or tablet devices</li>
				<li>Is fairly easy to design</li>
				<li>Looks professional</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
		
	<div class="pagecontent">	
		<p>I noticed most of the minamilist designs were in a form similar to most blogs and in my own notes and when designing referred to it as blog style, an example 
		of what i mean by this can be seen below</p>

	<img src="salee2.jpg" alt="Page content of Salee design" height="50%" width="30%" class="center">
	
	<div class="pagecontent">
		<p>This is again from the salee design website, this design is also the influence of the style i attempted with my Nav Bar by just having a fairly
		simple bar in the top right of the screen. As well as giving me thoughts for my own design for this current project researching the web design aspects was also quite
		interesting from a future stand point. I hope as a personal goal to be able to create websites of an equal standards to the ones i researched</p>
