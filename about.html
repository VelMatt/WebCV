	<h2>Summary</h2>
	
	<div class="pagecontent">
		<p>I am currently a student on the Software Engineering pathway at <a href="https://www.northampton.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Northampton University</b></a>. My long 
		term goal is to pass the course and begin a career in Software Engineering. My interest in this 
		comes from my work in the HR Department at MK Council where i worked on several projects with the SE team and became interested in 
		seeing it from the other side.<br>
		
		From my previous experience i have a good standard of working to a deadline or schedule from completing projects
		and working as a team. My current aspirations as a developer are to finish the course I am on and look to move into working within the professional world.</p>
